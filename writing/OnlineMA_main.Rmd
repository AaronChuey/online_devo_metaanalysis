abstract: |
  An increasing number of psychological experiments with children are being conducted using online platforms, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual replications have compared the findings of particular experiments online and in-person, but the general effect of online data collection on data collected from children is still unknown. Therefore, the current meta-analysis examines how the effect sizes of developmental studies conducted online compare to the same studies conducted in-person. Our pre-registered analysis includes 145 effect sizes calculated from 24 papers with 2440 children, ranging in age from four months to six years. We examined several moderators of the effect of online testing, including the role of dependent measure (looking vs verbal), online study method (moderated vs unmoderated), and age. The mean effect size of studies conducted in-person (d = .68) was slightly larger than the mean effect size of their counterparts conducted online (d = .54), but this difference was not significant. Additionally, we found no significant moderating effect of dependent measure, online study method, or age. Overall, the results of the current meta-analysis suggest developmental data collected online are generally comparable to data collected in-person.
